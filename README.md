# Youtube Motion Sensor
Project for sending directional, navigation inputs to Youtube using keyboard binds. These inputs are being recieved through Adafruit's ProxLight Trinkey M0.

## Requirements
Having the Proximity Trinkey makes this simpler as the sensor resides within Adafruit Trinket M0 Microcontroller board, making the experience "plug-n-play" out the box. However, for bare minimum, this code should also run as long as the sensor (Adafruit APDS9960) is present. 

## Installation
